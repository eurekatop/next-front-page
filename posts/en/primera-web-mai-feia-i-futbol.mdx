In a hyperconnected world where technology sets the rhythm of our daily lives, it seems impossible to imagine that it all started with a website as simple as it was revolutionary. But the first website —a basic CERN page created by Tim Berners-Lee— not only transformed how we share knowledge, it also reminds us of the power of teamwork. Just like in football, no lone genius can go far without a team creating the space for them to shine.

In modern football, this principle becomes evident with names like Lamine Yamal, the teenage star of Barça. His talent is undeniable, but what allows it to flourish is the network of teammates opening up space, a coach who trusts him, and a tactical system that propels him toward greatness. Just as the first website’s interconnected documents enabled navigation, in football, it’s the connection between players that turns a move into a goal.

This parallel is reinforced by team-building activities like the spaghetti challenge: teams have 18 minutes to build a structure using limited materials. The groups that collaborate, listen, and coordinate far outperform those led by a brilliant but isolated individual. In football, as in the web and in these challenges, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Just as the Library of Alexandria preserved ancient knowledge, the internet now connects us with all the wisdom in the world. But, as in football, it takes a team, trust, and collective play for a single player or idea to truly go far.
