When the contestant picks a door, the host opens another... and the universe of probability starts to shake. We're talking about the **Monty Hall problem**, a mathematical puzzle that defies intuition and reveals how little we truly understand statistics.

## What is the problem?

Based on the American game show *Let's Make a Deal*, the setup goes like this:

- There are three doors.
- Behind one is a car. The other two hide goats.
- You pick a door (say, door 1).
- The host, who **knows** where the prize is, opens another door (say, door 3) and shows a goat.
- Then he asks you: *"Do you want to switch to door 2?"*

Intuition says it’s 50-50. But it’s not.

## The correct answer almost no one accepts

The probability that the car is behind your initial choice is **1/3**. The probability that it’s behind one of the other two is **2/3**. When Monty opens a door with a goat, the full 2/3 probability transfers to **the other unopened door**. Switching **doubles** your chances of winning.

This result is so counterintuitive that even **professional mathematicians** have wrongly argued there's no difference. Marilyn vos Savant, considered one of the smartest people in the world, explained it correctly in *Parade Magazine*... and received thousands of letters saying she was wrong.

## Why is it so hard to grasp?

The human brain **doesn’t understand conditional probability** naturally. We think of percentages as fixed, forgetting how new evidence changes the rules of the game. It’s the same reason we get confused by medical tests, forecasts, and risk decisions.

## A real-life experiment

In one study, when students were given the problem, only **10% chose to switch**. After the logic was explained, that percentage multiplied. But it takes **seeing it repeated** to truly believe it.

## What the problem reveals

Monty Hall isn’t just a game. It’s a mirror. It reflects how we **prefer intuition over logic**, and how math education often fails to teach the *why*, not just the *how*
