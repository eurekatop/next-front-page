## How to Avoid Secret Leaks When Publishing a Project to Production

On May 2, 2025, at 02:41:37 AM, an IP address from Amsterdam (213.232.87.232) began systematically scanning your server. It wasn‚Äôt looking for web pages. It didn‚Äôt want to see content. It was looking for secrets. Were you ready?

This type of attack is more common than you think. And no, it‚Äôs not Hollywood-style ‚Äúhacking.‚Äù It‚Äôs just a machine making requests. But the requests are smart. And dangerous.

### üîç What was it looking for?

The list is chilling:

-   `/.vscode/sftp.json`
-   `/server.key`
-   `/.ssh/id_rsa`
-   `/backup.sql`
-   `/.env`
-   `/cloud-config.yml`
-   `/secrets.json`
-   `/docker-compose.yml`
-   `/config.php`
-   `/.aws/credentials`
-   `/.git/HEAD`
-   and many more...

All of them are files that have been mistakenly exposed to production in hundreds of projects around the world. And all of them may contain private keys, API secrets, credentials, sensitive configs, backups... everything.

### üìâ A single leak = disaster

When you publish a project‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre using frameworks like Laravel, Node.js, Django, etc.‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to forget about files like `.env`, `config.yml`, or entire directories like `.git/`. On StackOverflow and Hacker News, there are plenty of stories from developers who made this mistake, like the famous case where someone accidentally committed AWS keys to a public repository and within less than an hour, received bills for thousands of dollars due to malicious use of services like EC2 and S3.

### üîê Best Practices to Protect Secrets

According to secret detection platforms like [ScatteredSecrets](https://scatteredsecrets.com) and reports on malicious traffic, these are some practices that should be mandatory:

-   **Never publish your `.env` or sensitive config files.** Use `.gitignore`.
-   **Properly configure your server.** Any file starting with a dot (`.`) should be denied by the HTTP server.
-   **Avoid exposing directories like `.git`, `.svn`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, or `storage`.**
-   **Audit your repository.** Tools like [`git-secrets`](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) or [`truffleHog`] can help detect secrets before pushing code.
-   **Deploy only the production artifact.** Never the entire source. Use pipelines to clean and package.
-   **Monitor your logs.** Requests like the ones shown above are a clear alert that someone is scanning you.

### üõ°Ô∏è Your Server Withstood It‚Ä¶ This Time

Take a close look: many of the attack requests returned a `403 Forbidden` or a `404 Not Found`. Fortunately. But all it takes is one poorly configured leak to open the door.

The future of your systems depends on what you do today. Don‚Äôt wait to see a `GET /.env` with a `200 OK` in your logs to take action.
