**Have you lost your favorite adventures? No, they were just hidden in an emulator.**

We live in a world without shelves. No more dusty cardboard boxes or hand-labeled 3½” floppy disks. In an age of cloud, streaming, and subscriptions, we risk losing our collective digital memory: the games that shaped us, that defined our love for adventure, strategy, or action. Emulating old video games isn’t just nostalgia — it’s digital archaeology, autobiographical memory rendered in pixels.

Portals like [CPC-Power](https://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&num=298) are temples of [retrocomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocomputing). They preserve games that, without the community, would have vanished like so many decaying floppies. Retrocomputing isn’t a geeky fad — it’s a form of cultural resistance against planned obsolescence and amnesiac progress. It’s a tribute to a time when each game bore its creator’s imprint and every tape load was a ritual.

Today, we don’t keep the covers on the shelf. But we can preserve their essence. Just like the [Wayback Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine) captures lost websites, emulators let us relive experiences that would otherwise be lost forever. And this has a deeply human dimension. As memory psychology suggests, our emotional memories are central to understanding who we are. When we emulate *La Abadía del Crimen* or *Rick Dangerous*, we’re not just playing — we’re reconnecting with a younger version of ourselves.

It’s not just about “remembering when,” it’s about **feeling it**. Emulating old video games keeps part of us alive — a digital Library of Alexandria that, if we don’t preserve, might disappear forever.
